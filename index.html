    Each tag does something different. For example:
        - The <html> tag defines the whole document.
        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

               "Economic policies set out in the last 50 years in an attempt to reduce inequality in the UK have largely failed"

  <p>
     Despite fluctuations and even decreases in the last few years, all indicators point to inequality increasing over the last 50 years, supporting the above argument

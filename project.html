              As seen in the above chart, subscription video on demand (SVOD) platforms such as Netflix and Disney+ have skyrocketed in popularity in recent years, gaining hundreds of millions of subscribers. Much of this boost can be attributed to the Covid pandemic, since these services made the consumption of media much more accessible at the time, however they have continued to grow since. Furthermore, their varying portfolios of films and shows mean these companies are not substitutes for each other, leading to a population who pay for multiple SVODs at any one time:

              This has propelled the streaming industry so far that many of these companies have overtaken the familiar networks that dominated our screens for so long. In fact, Netflix, Disney+, and Paramount made up nearly a quarter of all screen time on US televisions in August this year:

Streaming services are now a massive aspect of entertainment, but what does this mean for the film industry? There are worries amongst fans and those in the industry about the newfound accessibility of films online, and the effect that it will have on the production and release of films in cinemas. In this project, I aim to discover whether these worries are irrational, or whether there is some weight behind them.            </p>

            <h3>The Data:</h3>
            <p> 
              The data on the SVODs was trickier to find than first predicted. Many of the companies this project is focussed on are not completely transparent about, for example, their subscription numbers, and where they were, it was often behind a paywall. Fortunately, statistics companies such as Statista had compiled all the data from the different companies into nice datasets that were a lot more accessible. <br /><br />When it came to looking at costs and revenues of film production, it was a lot easier to find. Statista was again a big help, but IMDB was largely the pillar of this part of the project. They not only have data on individual films, and their budgets and box office revenues, but also have global totals for across the years.<br /><br />Much of the data I accessed was already in the form of a downloadable excel spreadsheet, however there were two cases in which I used pandas to scrape a website. The tables on these sites that I scraped were friendly to scraping and weren’t too difficult to replicate into excel.

Much of the data I accessed was already in the form of a downloadable excel spreadsheet, however there were two cases in which I used pandas to scrape a website. The tables on these sites that I scraped were friendly to scraping and weren’t too difficult to replicate into excel.<br /><br />Another problem I faced was missing values in some of my charts. For example, with international data, some countries simply didn’t have a record of relevant data, or the data they had was unreliable or an estimate. In these cases, I removed them from the dataset entirely to keep the data as true as possible. <br /><br />In one set of charts that was designed to show growth over time, monthly fluctuations in value made it hard to see a pattern with the naked eye. To combat this, I added regression lines for clarity.

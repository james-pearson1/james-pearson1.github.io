              As seen in the above chart, subscription video on demand (SVOD) platforms such as Netflix and Disney+ have skyrocketed in popularity in recent years, gaining hundreds of millions of subscribers. Much of this boost can be attributed to the Covid pandemic, since these services made the consumption of media much more accessible at the time, however they have continued to grow since. Furthermore, their varying portfolios of films and shows mean these companies are not substitutes for each other, leading to a population who pay for multiple SVODs at any one time:

              This has propelled the streaming industry so far that many of these companies have overtaken the familiar networks that dominated our screens for so long. In fact, Netflix, Disney+, and Paramount made up nearly a quarter of all screen time on US televisions in August this year:

Streaming services are now a massive aspect of entertainment, but what does this mean for the film industry? There are worries amongst fans and those in the industry about the newfound accessibility of films online, and the effect that it will have on the production and release of films in cinemas. In this project, I aim to discover whether these worries are irrational, or whether there is some weight behind them.            </p>
